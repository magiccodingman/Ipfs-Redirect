# Ipfs-Redirect

Create your own IPFS redirect link to help others easily access your IPFS site!

## Introduction

IPFS is a powerful tool for decentralized web hosting, but its adoption has been slow due to accessibility challenges. This project aims to simplify the process of sharing IPFS links by creating an easy-to-use redirect system.

I've been working on this with others in various forums, testing and refining it before making it publicly available. The project includes a small, 26 KB HTML file that acts as a redirect link and a helpful wiki on IPFS usage.

You can access the project via IPFS:
- [Web3 Domain](https://ipfs-redirect.unstoppable/)
- [Web3 Domain Alternative](https://ipfsredirect.unstoppable/)
- [Web3 Version Hosting](https://ipfsredirect-version.unstoppable/)
- [Web2 Domain](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQonrckXZq37ZHDoRGN4xVBkqedvJRgYyzp2aBC5Ujpyp)

The web2 link is the public gateway link to the web2 version which means you won't need Brave browser or extensions. But this is a static link, so you won't be able to see updates. This links to v4 updated on 9/6/24 but I'm not promising to update this link here reliably. Because I'll probably forget. Use the web3 domains for the newest versions.

The officially posted versions to the web3 domains. I do try to minify them before publishing. Which usually cuts roughly 30% off the size.

Additionally, when redirecting to web3 domains instead of a CID. The user will get a different screen if they use the link on any browser that's not Brave browser.

**IMPORTANT NOTE***:
Please always reference the Web3 domain created to see what the latest link and CID is. I'll update it over time to any new version. And if you choose to support the project, it'd incredibly appreciated if you keep track of the changes occassionally and pin the newest. Thank you!

## Why This Project?

While IPFS is fast when accessed directly, sharing IPFS sites with others can be challenging. This project provides a solution by offering a redirect link that either sends users directly to the site or guides them through setting up IPFS if needed.

## Features

### Wiki Capabilities

The main page includes:
- An introduction to IPFS.
- A simple wiki with guides on using and setting up IPFS.
- Best practices for supporting IPFS projects while managing bandwidth.

### Redirect Creator

Creating a redirect link is easy:
1. Navigate to the **Redirect Helper** from the menu.
2. Enter your IPFS CID in the text box.
3. Click **Generate Link**.

This will create a custom redirect URL that integrates your CID.

### How the Redirect Link Works

The generated redirect link is connected to the original CID and customizes the instructions provided to the user. The goal is to be informative without being intrusive.

Key features:
- A **Continue to Site** button that follows the user across pages.
- Automatic wrapping of the CID in an HTTPS gateway if the user hasn't set up IPFS.
- Gateway redundancy to ensure reliability.
- More! I just am too lazy right now to properly document.

## Supporting the Project

Note that the site may load slowly due to limited hosting. Please consider supporting the project by pinning the CID on your IPFS node to improve speed and reliability.
If you appreciate the project, a tip never hurts! Though a pinned CID is just as good ;)

## Conclusion

This project was a fun and small experiment aimed at making IPFS more accessible. It’s not perfect, but it’s a step toward simplifying decentralized web access. If you find it useful, please consider pinning the CID and spreading the word.
